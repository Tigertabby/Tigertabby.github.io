      <h1>The legacy of the mutineer</h1>
      <h2>A seriously wounded man escapes from the troops of the Scottish King in Kelso Abbey. Before succumbing to his injuries there, he made his last confession in front of the abbot, in which he reported the secret treasures of the Macdonnell of Glengarry clan and gave the abbot a compass. It doesn't take long before the king's Scottish troops visit the compartment. They seem to be looking for more than just the stranger's corpse. Reason enough for the abbot to become active himself and to research what the clan and especially the compass are all about. An exciting film set in the deep Middle Ages.<br> Main actors:<br> Ian McFarland as Abbot and Stew Stevenson as King of Scotland. <br>114 minutes of pure excitement.<br>Produced in Alpha Studios in Oregon / USA in 2021.
