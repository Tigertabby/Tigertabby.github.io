      <h1>The dark side of Sir Francis</h1>
      <p class="intro">Sir Francis is still considered one of the great economists of his time. With investments in the Hoover Dam, the Panama Canal and the Australian Oil Corp. he made billions. But was he really the charming, confident and above all honest person that those around him thought he was? Based on many years of research, this film was shot by Ruth Melspring in Croydon in 2020. A captivating drama gives us an insight into the dark machinations and the depths of the financial world.</p>
