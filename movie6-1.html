    <h1><em>Pirates of the Ocean</em></h1>
<h2><em>Plot:</em></h2>
<p>When we think of Robert Stevenson's "Treasure Island", we immediately remember Captain Flint, the infamous pirate who buried all that gold on Treasure Island. We may also remember Jim Hawkins, Captain Smollet, Mr. Livesey and Mr. Trelawney, who returned home to the UK with the unearthed treasures after a dangerous journey. But what actually happened to Long John Silver, the notorious cook with the wooden leg and the parrot? He too was one of Flint's pirates. He was to be brought to England as a prisoner, where the gallows awaited him. But Jim Hawkings made it possible for him to escape. This engaging film reveals some of the adventures Silver went through after his escape ...</p>
